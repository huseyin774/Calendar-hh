### HTML (`index.html`)

The main structure of the calendar, including a toolbar for month navigation and a container for the calendar days.

### CSS (`styles.css`)

Beautiful styles that make the calendar visually appealing. It includes a radial background gradient and smooth hover effects to make the calendar interactive.

### JavaScript (`script.js`)

This script handles the calendar's core functionality:
- Displays the current month and year.
- Navigates between months.
- Highlights the current day.
- Dynamically renders the days of each month, adjusting for previous and next month's padding days.

## 🎨 Customization

- **Change the Colors**: Modify the gradient background or button colors in the `styles.css` file to fit your project.
- **Adjust Font**: The `Quicksand` font is imported from Google Fonts, but you can easily swap it for another by changing the `@import` line.
- **Extend Functionality**: Want to add event markers or integrate a scheduling feature? You can enhance the `script.js` file to accommodate additional features.

## 🌟 Future Enhancements

Some ideas for future updates:
